The idea is to revise the entire value chain around the principle of circularity (➜ Read more: Circular economy for more sustainability and luxury in 2040) and ultimately to reduce the carbon footprint of BMW vehicles, rather than limiting the task to simply converting to electric engines. That leads, as Horstmeier describes it, to a transformation phase towards sustainability, not only when it comes to production, but also socially and economically by securing jobs and providing employees with qualifications of future competencies.";
